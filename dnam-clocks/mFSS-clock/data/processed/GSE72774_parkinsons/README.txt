Title	DNA methylation profiles of human blood samples from Caucasian subjects with Parkinson's disease
Organism	Homo sapiens
Experiment type	Methylation profiling by genome tiling array
Summary	Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to profile 508 whole blood samples.
The main goal of the study was to relate Parkinson's disease status to measures of epigenetic age acceleration based on DNA methylation data. Here we focus on Caucasian subjects. To measure DNA methylation age, we used the epigenetic clock software described in Horvath S (n=2013) DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types. Genome Biology.2013, 14:R115. DOI: 10.1186/10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115 PMID: 24138928.
 	
Overall design	We analyzed whole blood samples from n=508 samples (289 subjects with PD and 219 control samples). The data come from The Parkinson's disease, Environment, and Genes (PEG) case-control study (wave 1) that aims to identify environmental risk factors (e.g. neurotoxic pesticide exposures) for Parkinson's disease.
